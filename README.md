## Project Description
Our project is a web application that helps people keep track of their job applications. Users input a link to a job posting, 
and the application will scrape the job posting for relevant information such as the job title, company, location, and job 
description. Users can then view all of their job applications in a table format, and they can filter the table by company, 
location, and job title. The application is built using Express, Vite, React.js, and MongoDB.

## Demo
A demo of the application will be posted at the end of the hackathon.
